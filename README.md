# COMP2132 Final Project
This web app initiates a game of dice, in which the user plays against a computer to see who can roll the highest score after three rounds.

### Rules
1. There will be three rounds
2. Each round, you and the computer will face off by rolling two dice each
3. Each round you will earn a score based on your dice roll:
    * If either of your dice are a 1, your score for that round is 0
    * If you roll two of the same number (except 1), your score for that round is twice the sum of the dice values
   * Otherwise, your score for that round is the sum of the two dice values
4. After three rounds, the player with the highest total score wins!
